# üß† Terminal-Based Pok√©mon Personality Quiz

## How Matching Works:

- Your answers are converted into a stat profile, containing 6 different values relating to Pok√©mon characteristics.
- Uses Cosine Similarity & Euclidean Distance with 70% and 30% weight respectively.
- You might notice that even if the user's stats have different absolute values - they might still be matched with the same Pok√©mon. That's because Cosine Similarity focuses on the direction of the vector, not the magnitude. Euclidean Distance helps balance that by factoring in how far apart the actual values are.

## Features
